# Connectivity planning tool

## Development


The stack:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) as the build tool
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) as the UI framework
- [Carbon](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-svelte) as the component library
- [MapLibre GL](https://maplibre.org) as the map

You'll need
[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Run

```bash
npm install # once
```

and then

```bash
npm run dev
```

to work locally. 

To auto-format code and check for warnings:

```bash
npm run fmt
npm run lint
```
